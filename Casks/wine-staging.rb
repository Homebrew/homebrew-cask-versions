  caveats <<~EOS
    #{token} supports both 32-bit and 64-bit. It is compatible with an existing
    32-bit wine prefix, but it will now default to 64-bit when you create a new
    wine prefix. The architecture can be selected using the WINEARCH environment
    variable which can be set to either win32 or win64.

    To create a new pure 32-bit prefix, you can run:
      $ WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 winecfg

    See the Wine FAQ for details: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#Wineprefixes
