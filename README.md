## Acceptable Casks

`homebrew/cask-versions` is not intended to be used for all and any old versions you personally require. Casks submitted here should be expected to be used by a reasonable number of people and supported by contributors long-term.

You may wish to consider hosting your own [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md) for casks you wish to personally support that do not meet the above standards.

For this repo, rules are (following our [nomenclature](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md#finding-a-home-for-your-cask)):

+ Include the latest minor version of legacy versions of commercial and freemium software.
+ Legacy versions of commercial and freemium software are restricted to a maximum of five casks.
+ Include beta, development, unstable, nightly, early access program, â€¦.
+ Refuse legacy versions of gratis or open-source software, unless there is a clear demonstrable need for them.
+ Legacy versions of gratis or open-source software that were accepted should be removed after one year.
+ Include casks that do not fit the rules, but need to exist somewhere since they are required by other casks.
